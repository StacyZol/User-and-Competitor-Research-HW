John / Aug 7 2016 (Stacy)
1 - Mostly listening to news radio/Sirius XM.  Local FM for local news, XM for CNN & Fox.  Also, evening news on TV.
2 - Yes, see previous answer. 
3 - "Read" the news – very rarely.  Consume news – multiple times/day.
4 - I don't read the news often, because I find it easier and more timely to get "live" news.  Even online sites tend to lag in their timeliness.
5 - National events, politics, sports.
6 - Timeliness; ability to alert on topic types or keywords; delivery of news in both written and video (where available).  I have it when your only option is to watch video online (CNN does this a lot).
7 - I'd want to have most likely/relevant stories based on my past consumption, but also a "You may also like" section that surfaces news stories outside of my common interests.
8 - Facebook if I want to share with my personal friends; LinkedIn and Twitter if I'm sharing something aligned with my professional interests.
